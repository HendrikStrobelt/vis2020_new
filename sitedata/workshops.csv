a,"VISxAI - 3rd Workshop on Visualization for AI Explainability","Adam Perer|Duen Horng (Polo) Chau|Fred Hohman|Hendrik Strobelt|Mennatallah El-Assady","The role of visualization in artificial intelligence (AI) gained significant attention in recent years. With the growing complexity of AI models, the critical need for understanding their inner-workings has increased. Visualization is potentially a powerful technique to fill such a critical need. The goal of this workshop is to initiate a call for 'explainables / 'explorables' that explain how AI techniques work using visualization. We believe the VIS community can leverage their expertise in creating visual narratives to bring new insight into the often obfuscated complexity of AI systems."
b,"Visualization in Data Science (VDS at IEEE VIS 2020)","many","Visualization is an integral part of data science, and essential to enable sophisticated analysis of data. After four highly successful events, the sixth Symposium on Visualization in Data Science (VDS) will again be held at IEEE VIS 2020 in Salt Lake City, Utah. VDS will bring together domain scientists and methods researchers (including visualization, usability and HCI, data management, statistics, machine learning, and software engineering) to discuss common interests, talk about practical issues, and identify open research problems in visualization in data science."
